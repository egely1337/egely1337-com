    ["Hi, I'm Ege. As a person who doesn't like to talk much, I'll be brief. I'm of legal age, interested in software and politics. I spent most of my life in software. I don't regret it either. I have experience in C, C++, C#, Python, Javascript, Typescript languages and Web, OpenGL. In my free time I like to do difficult things from scratch. Sometimes I act toxic and sometimes normal. We are all human after all. Sometimes I watch anime, usually romantic anime. Am I ashamed of it? Yes. Anyway, you can see my social media and internet links below. You can reach me from there. By the way, \
    if you noticed, the site is very simple; Yes, I like simplicity. Have a good day!!!",

    "On the political compass, I see myself as libertarian center-left. I don't usually put it like that, I call myself a direct democrat.  I find laissez-faire, freedom of speech, participatory democracy right. In software, I support and contribute to free software. "
